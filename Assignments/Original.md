# Source

I have, as of yet, not found out what the original source is for this sample / practice exam.

Per June of 2023, I knew of both a Google Doc and a Github repo which served identical content:

* [https://github.com/khamidziyo/sampleexam180](https://github.com/khamidziyo/sampleexam180)
* [Google Docs EX180 sample exam](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS-91bm_QXLo4oRy94wB0FPxzNk-yAhCs9gE2ljU9xjTGGtHmCXdc7TVBalhr59bl49-qZDJuSP0bDL/pub)

I can't tell if they were made by the same person, or if one copied from another. 

I will not include the original texts here, on the off chance that it was a stolen and real exam.
