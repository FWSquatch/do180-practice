# Notes from Red Hat
As with all Red Hat performance-based exams, configurations must persist after reboot without intervention.

During the exam you may be required to work with one or more pre-written applications. You will not be required to modify application code however in some cases you may need to utilize supplied documentation in order to produce a new deployment of a given application.


# Not on the exam

The accompanying training DO188 includes topics which are **not** on the EX188 exam. These topics include:

* Red Hat OpenShift
* Kubernetes

The exam website mentions that:

> "This exam is based on RHEL9, podman v4.4 and OCP v4.14 [...]"

But the exam objectives have no mention at all of OCP (OpenShift Container Platform).
